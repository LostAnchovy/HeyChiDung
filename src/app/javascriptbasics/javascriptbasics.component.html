      <h2 class="text-center">JavaScript’s this Keyword Basics</h2>
      <p>First, know that all functions in JavaScript have properties, just as objects have properties. And when a
        function executes, it gets the this property—a variable with the value of the object that invokes the function
        where this is used.</p>
      <p><span class="font-weight-bold">The this reference ALWAYS refers to (and holds the value of) an object—a
          singular object—and it is usually used inside a function or a method, although it can be used outside a
          function in the global scope</span>. Note that when we use strict mode, this holds the value of undefined in
        global functions and in anonymous functions that are not bound to any object.</p>
      <p>this is used inside a function (let’s say function A) and it contains the value of the object that invokes
        function A. We need this to access methods and properties of the object that invokes function A, especially
        since we don’t always know the name of the invoking object, and sometimes there is no name to use to refer to
        the invoking object. Indeed, this is really just a shortcut reference for the “antecedent object”—the invoking
        object.</p>

      <h2 class="text-center">Promises</h2>
      <p> A promise is a guarantee that what said I am going to do I am going to do it.
        It is a receipt of a transaction that will eventually return what was being asked for by the user.</p>
      <p>For example when I buy fast food, I pay for the food first. I am then given a receipt with an order number
        that promises to deliver me the food once it is prepared and completed. This is basically how promises work in
        computer programming. A user makes a request to the server. The computer goes ahead and processes the user
        request and issues a promise. The user can go and perform other functions with this promise while the server
        processes the request. If it is unable to deliver the promise the user is provided with an error message
        explaining why It was unable to full fill the promise. Promises help with Asynchronous operations by increasing
        the efficiency of executing programs and code. </p>
