        <h2>Introduction to React Components</h2>
        <p>Component are the basic UI building blocks for your application. Let’s take for example this view. How many
          components can you spot out? Well let’s see. There is top navigation bar, side angular module bar, main body
          component and the footer. As a whole, they make up the entire view that is displayed. </p>
        <p class="bold-text">Facebooks Definition of React.Js</p>
        <blockquote class="mt-2">
          <p>"Components are the most basic UI building block of an Angular app. An Angular app contains a tree of Angular
            components.Angular components are a subset of directives, always associated with a template. Unlike other
            directives, only one component can be instantiated per an element in a template.</p>
        </blockquote>
          <h2 id="components">Types of React Components</h2>
          <p>As we covered, components are modularized blocks of code that make up your entire view. However, each
            component is made up of four files: Css, Html, Spect.ts, and a TS (Typescript) files. Each of the file plays
            and important role, however, for now lets just focus on the three main ones, Css, Html, and TS.</p>
          <p>The HTML is the basic mark up language, Css is the presentation layer, and the TS files is where your
            application functions will reside. Functions such as Logout, API request to your server, and connecting to
            services that you may want to build. We will dive into that later.</p>
